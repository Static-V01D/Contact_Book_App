// This code defines a MyAppBar component that serves as a customizable app bar for a React Native application using React Native Paper. The component accepts props for navigation, back button visibility, and title text. It conditionally renders a back button if the back prop is true, allowing users to navigate to the previous screen. The Appbar.Content component displays the title of the current screen. If the back prop is false, an additional action button (dots-vertical icon) is rendered, which can be used to open options or perform other actions. The component is styled using the Appbar.Header component from React Native Paper, providing a consistent look and feel across the application. This app bar can be reused in different screens to maintain a uniform navigation experience.
// The MyAppBar component enhances user experience by providing clear navigation options and a consistent design, making it a valuable part of the application's user interface.
